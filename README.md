# Marshmallow Comet Effect
Imagine if floating marshmallows got some physics, in zero gravity~ and pop! they flies away! isn't it good?

The objective of this project is to represent comet effects in HTML5 in a different way. It can be a useful project for static webpages for interactivity and fun. ðŸ˜‰

The another part denotes the use of pure Javascript, as a message to not be dependent on libraries when you really don't need them. Also CSS variables have made more easier to interact with real-time coding and unlocked millions of opportunities to show your creativity.

## Browser Compatibility

I was very excited to see if it works on major browsers like Chrome, Firefox and others. Currently tested on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and works fine enough. Not sure about Opera, IE and Edge, may be opera needs -webkit- prefixes on transition and transform properties.
